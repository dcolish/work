Stupid simple time tracking

Tracking time for your agile work shouldn't be hard. Work is here to help keep
it that way. Starting tasks starts the timer. Starting another stops any which
are in progress. You can also manually stop. Listing shows a nice chart of what
you've done and gives me detail only when you ask for it.
